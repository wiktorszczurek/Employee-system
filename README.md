The "Employee System" application is an advanced tool for managing employees in the company. It is currently used and functioning in the company. It has a number of functions:


User Management System: The capability to add new employees, authorize them, and manage their roles, including the main administrator, tip administrator, scheduler, and regular employees.

Task Categories: Assigning specific duties and work categories to employees.

RFID Reader System: Employees "check-in" at the beginning and end of their shifts using the RFID system, which automatically tallies the number of hours worked.

Schedule Management: Administrators can set work schedules, while employees have access to their schedules for the current month and for their specific category.

Review of Work and Tips: Employees can check the number of hours worked and tips received, as well as compare schedules from previous months.

Checklist System: Allows for verifying and confirming that all tasks for the day have been completed.

Communication and Notifications: Chat and messages for individual categories and a notification system for users.

Leave Management: Overview of available leave days, used, and remaining.

Main Administrator Panel: Comprehensive tools for managing employees, including adding users, resetting passwords, updating RFID data, reviewing activity, managing shifts, and analyzing employee data such as hours worked, tips, punctuality, and checklist activity.

Editing and Customization: Administrators have broad capabilities to edit and customize schedules, user information, and manage the entire system.

Email Communication: The main administrator receives notifications about schedule changes and other important information via email.

Logging in with an RFID reader: To start or end a shift, employees use their RFID identifiers. When an employee scans their card or fob at the reader, the system automatically registers the time of entry or exit, allowing for precise tracking of the number of hours worked. This solution is quick and convenient, minimizing the risk of errors or forgetting to manually record work time.

Logging in with a PIN: For access to more detailed system functions, such as reviewing their own activities, schedules, tips, leaves, or checklists, employees can log in using a personal PIN. Upon logging in, they have access to the user panel, where they can analyze and compare their statistics, view work schedules, communicate with others, and check their tasks.
